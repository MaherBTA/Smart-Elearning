A resource element (RE) contains,
One symbol,
A variable number of symbols (it depends on the chosen modulation),
One bit,
A variable number of bits (it depends on the chosen modulation).

A Resource Block (RB) typically contains,
7 resource elements (RE),
12 resource elements (RE),
84 resource elements (RE),
A variable number of resource elements (RE). 

In LTE, resources are allocated,
every 0.5ms,
every 1ms correct,
for a fixed duration upon the connection of a UE.

The transmission duration of a transport block is,
Always equal to or less than 0.5ms,
Always equal to or less than 1ms correct,
Can be over 1ms if the size of the block is important. 

The size of the transport blocks (number of bits per transport block),
Is fixed,
Can vary depending on the modulation used,
Can vary depending on the number of available resource blocks.
