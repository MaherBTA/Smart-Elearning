The MAC layer processes errors at the level of:
the resource elements (RE)
the resource blocks (RB)
the transport blocks correct
the IP packets.

In the case of an error, the retransmission occurs:
in the sub-frame following the transmission, thanks to the acknowledgement system
within 4ms after the transmission because the transmitter needs time to get prepared
8ms later.

The parallelized send and wait:
is only implemented on the base station
can lead to un-sequencings
is handled by the RLC layer (which is above the MAC layer)
allows several logical channels to be multiplexed
allows the throughput to be increased up to 8 times.

The MAC-PDU is a:
RLC-SDU
RLC-PDU
transport block correct
resource block.

In the downlink, a MAC-PDU can (several answers expected):
contain data intended for different terminals
group data from different sources
group data of different types
group data from signaling protocols and some user data.
