We consider the configuration of the illustration above with a UE, the eNodeB, SGW and PGW of a mobile operator and the intermediate routers. The mobile terminal (i.e. the UE) with the address 193.137.99.99 received data from a server with the address 192.108.117.241. In every question, we consider a packet transmitted by the server to the UE.

What is the destination address in the IP packet circulating on the Internet.


This packet is routed,
directly to the UE without crossing any intermediate device,
to the PGW,
to the router with the address.

How is this packet transported to the mobile terminal,
the routing tables of all the core network devices (eNB, SGW, PGW, routers) are modified to make sure the packet is correctly routed to the location of the terminal,
the packet is systematically transmitted to all the eNodeBs via a flooding process to make sure it reaches the eNB where the terminal is located,
the packet is placed in another packet to be transmitted from the PGW to the SGW then to the eNB where the terminal is located,
the packet is placed in another packet to be directly transmitted from the PGW to the eNB where the terminal is located.
