Each tunnel is identified,
by a unique number in the network,
by a pair of numbers allocated by the terminal and the HSS,
by a pair of numbers each allocated by the device at the end of this tunnel.

The TEID (Tunnel End Point Identifier)
is coded over 3 bits,
is coded over 8 bits,
is coded over 32 bits,
is coded over 128 bits.

The TEID (Tunnel EndPoint Identifier),
is added to the IP header,
replaces the source IP address in the IP header,
is added to the UDP header,
is placed in the GTP header,
is placed at the end of the packet at the software level.

Consider a packet transmitted in a tunnel from the SGW to the PGW. The TEID that is placed in the GTP header,
is the one allocated by a central entity, the MME in this case,
is the one allocated by the SGW,
is the one allocated by the PGW.
