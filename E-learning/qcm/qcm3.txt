In LTE, the radio resource allocation is handled by:
The core network 
eNodeBs correct 
Terminals 
jointly by eNodeBs and Terminals. 

Devices that have nothing to transmit use as much resources as the others
True
False.

On the downlink, only the base station transmits
True 
False.

The eNB can transmit on the uplink (from the UEs to the eNB).
True
False.

The RNTI 
Is a short address calculated from the IMSI 
Is determined by the UE 
Is determined by the eNB 
Is a way to uniquely identify a terminal within a cell.


The base station publishes:
The allocation table of the downlink for the current sub-frame 
The allocation table of the downlink 4 sub-frames in advance 
The allocation table of the uplink for the current sub-frame 
The allocation table of the uplink 4 sub-frames in advance.

If they only have a small amount of data to send, terminals can transmit on the control channel of the uplink 
True 
False.
